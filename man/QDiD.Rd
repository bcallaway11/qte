\usage{
QDiD(formla, xformla = NULL, t, tmin1, tname, x = NULL, data,
  dropalwaystreated = TRUE, panel = FALSE, se = TRUE, idname = NULL,
  method = NULL, uniqueid = NULL, alp = 0.05, probs = seq(0.05, 0.95,
  0.05), iters = 100, retEachIter = FALSE, seedvec = NULL,
  printIter = F, pl = FALSE, cores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{The formula y ~ d where y is the outcome and d is the
treatment indicator (d should be binary)}

\item{xformla}{A optional one sided formula for additional covariates that
will be adjusted for.  E.g ~ age + education.  Additional covariates can
also be passed by name using the x paramater.}

\item{t}{The 3rd time period in the sample (this is the name of the column)}

\item{tmin1}{The 2nd time period in the sample (this is the name of the
column)}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{x}{An optional vector of covariates (the name of the columns).
Covariates can also be passed in formulat notation using the
xformla paramter.}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{dropalwaystreated}{How to handle always treated observations
in panel data case (not currently used)}

\item{panel}{Binary variable indicating whether or not the dataset is
panel.  This is used for computing bootstrap standard errors correctly.}

\item{se}{Boolean whether or not to compute standard errors}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{method}{The method for estimating the propensity score when covariates
are included}

\item{uniqueid}{Not sure if this is used anymore}

\item{alp}{The significance level used for constructing bootstrap
confidence intervals}

\item{probs}{A vector of values between 0 and 1 to compute the QTET at}

\item{iters}{The number of iterations to compute bootstrap standard errors.
This is only used if se=TRUE}

\item{retEachIter}{Boolean whether or not to return list of results
from each iteration of the bootstrap procedure}

\item{seedvec}{Optional value to set random seed; can possibly be used
in conjunction with bootstrapping standard errors.}

\item{printIter}{Boolean only used for debugging}

\item{pl}{boolean for whether or not to compute bootstrap error in parallel.
Note that computing standard errors in parallel is a new feature and may
not work at all on Windows.}

\item{cores}{the number of cores to use if bootstrap standard errors are
computed in parallel}

\description{
\code{QDiD} is a Difference in Differences type method for
computing the QTET.

The method can accommodate conditioning on covariates though it does so
in a restrictive way:  It specifies a linear model for outcomes conditional
on group-time dummies and covariates.  Then, after residualizing (see details
in Athey and Imbens (2006)), it computes the Change in Changes model
based on these quasi-residuals.
