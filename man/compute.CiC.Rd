\usage{
compute.CiC(formla, xformla = NULL, t, tmin1, tname, x = NULL, data,
  dropalwaystreated = TRUE, panel = FALSE, idname = NULL,
  uniqueid = NULL, probs = seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05))
}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{The formula y ~ d where y is the outcome and d is the
treatment indicator (d should be binary)}

\item{xformla}{A optional one sided formula for additional covariates that
will be adjusted for.  E.g ~ age + education.  Additional covariates can
also be passed by name using the x paramater.}

\item{t}{The 3rd time period in the sample (this is the name of the column)}

\item{tmin1}{The 2nd time period in the sample (this is the name of the
column)}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{x}{An optional vector of covariates (the name of the columns).
Covariates can also be passed in formulat notation using the
xformla paramter.}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{dropalwaystreated}{How to handle always treated observations
in panel data case (not currently used)}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{uniqueid}{Not sure what this does}

\item{probs}{A vector of values between 0 and 1 to compute the QTET at}
