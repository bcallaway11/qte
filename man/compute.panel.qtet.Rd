compute.panel.qtet(qp)
}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{outcome variable on treatment}

\item{t}{last time period}

\item{tmin1}{middle time period}

\item{tmin2}{initial time period}

\item{x}{additional covariates if using propensity score
reweighting technique}

\item{dropalwaystreated}{boolean indicating whether in true panel data
context (when treatment can occur in any period) whether or
not previously treated observations should be dropped from the sample.
This functionality is not currently implemented}

should be computed}

method is used to compute standard errors}
