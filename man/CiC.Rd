\usage{
CiC(formla, xformla = NULL, t, tmin1, tname, data, panel = FALSE,
  se = TRUE, idname = NULL, alp = 0.05, probs = seq(0.05, 0.95,
  0.05), iters = 100, pl = FALSE, cores = 2, retEachIter = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{The formula y ~ d where y is the outcome and d is the
treatment indicator (d should be binary), d should be equal to one
in all time periods for individuals that are eventually treated}

\item{xformla}{A optional one sided formula for additional covariates that
will be adjusted for.  E.g ~ age + education.  Additional covariates can
also be passed by name using the x paramater.}

\item{t}{The 3rd time period in the sample.  Treated individuals should
be treated in this time period and untreated individuals should not be
treated.  The code attempts to enforce this condition, but it is good
try to handle this outside the panel.qtet method.}

\item{tmin1}{The 2nd time period in the sample.  This should be a
pre-treatment period for all individuals in the sample.}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing all the variables used}

\item{panel}{Binary variable indicating whether or not the dataset is
panel.  This is used for computing bootstrap standard errors correctly.}

\item{se}{Boolean whether or not to compute standard errors}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{alp}{The significance level used for constructing bootstrap
confidence intervals}

\item{probs}{A vector of values between 0 and 1 to compute the QTET at}

\item{iters}{The number of iterations to compute bootstrap standard errors.
This is only used if se=TRUE}

\item{pl}{Whether or not to compute standard errors in parallel}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use if computing in parallel}

\item{retEachIter}{Boolean whether or not to return list of results
from each iteration of the bootstrap procedure (default is FALSE).
This is potentially useful for debugging but can cause errors due
to running out of memory.}

\description{
\code{CiC} computes the Quantile Treatment Effect on the
 Treated (QTET) using the method of Athey and Imbens (2006).  \code{CiC}
 is a Difference in Differences type method.  It requires
 having two periods of data that can be either  repeated cross sections
 or panel data.

The method can accommodate conditioning on covariates though it does so
in a restrictive way:  It specifies a linear model for outcomes conditional
on group-time dummies and covariates.  Then, after residualizing (see details
in Athey and Imbens (2006)), it computes the Change in Changes model
based on these quasi-residuals.

\examples{
## load the data
data(lalonde)
## Run the Change in Changes model conditioning on age, education,
## black, hispanic, married, and nodegree
c1 <- CiC(re ~ treat, t=1978, tmin1=1975, tname="year",
 xformla=~age + I(age^2) + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree,
 data=lalonde.psid.panel, idname="id", se=FALSE,
 probs=seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05))
