\description{
\code{compute.spatt} implements the method of Abadie (2005); this is
computed automatically in several other methods in the qte package
but this function provides a standalone result when quantiles are not
wanted/needed.

\code{compute.ddid2} uses two periods of data (repeated cross sections
or panel) to estimate the Quantile Treatment Effect on the Treated (QTET)
