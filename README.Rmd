The R `qte` package implements many methods used, especially in economics, to estimate quantile treatment effects.  These include the case where treatment is randomly assigned, under selection on observables, under a Difference in Differences Assumtpion.

The package is available on CRAN and can be loaded as follows
```{r, eval=FALSE}
  library(qte)
```

The following example shows how to use the `ci.qte` method in the `qte` package using data about an experimental job training program.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data(lalonde)
 jt.cia <- ci.qte(re78 ~ treat,
   xformla=~age + education + black + hispanic + married + nodegree,
   data=lalonde.psid,
   probs=seq(0.05,0.95,0.05), se=T)
 summary(jt.cia)
```

More examples and details about other functions in the package can be found at the package's [website](http://bcallaway11.github.io/qte/)
